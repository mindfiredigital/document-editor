<!-- 
    [anchorEl]="anchorEl.nativeElement" 
    The `anchorEl` input property is currently removed out because:
    1. It is not defined or implemented in the `app-color-palette` component.
    2. Its purpose and usage are unclear, and it may be unnecessary or obsolete.
    3. If this property is required for positioning or functionality, it needs clarification 
       and implementation in both the parent and child components.
